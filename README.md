# Image Processing Projects

## Overview
This repository contains four projects focused on different aspects of image processing, including character isolation, contrast correction, noise reduction, edge detection, and Fourier transform. Each project applies various techniques to manipulate and enhance images. The repository is designed to help users explore key concepts in image processing through Python-based implementations.

## Projects

### 1. **Isolating Characters - Processing Chain**
   This project demonstrates how to isolate characters from an image using a series of image processing steps. The process includes:
   - Grayscale conversion
   - Thresholding
   - Morphological operations
   - Contour detection for isolating individual characters from text images

   **Techniques Used:**
   - Binarization
   - Dilation/Erosion
   - Contour analysis

### 2. **Contrast Correction**
   In this project, contrast enhancement techniques are applied to improve the visibility of details in images. The methods used include:
   - Histogram equalization
   - Adaptive contrast enhancement
   - CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization)

   **Techniques Used:**
   - Histogram Equalization
   - CLAHE

### 3. **Filters: Noise Reduction and Edge Detection**
   This project explores the use of filters to reduce noise and detect edges in images. Various filters are implemented to highlight the edges and remove noise while preserving image quality.
   - Gaussian Blur for noise reduction
   - Median Filter for salt-and-pepper noise
   - Sobel and Canny filters for edge detection

   **Techniques Used:**
   - Gaussian Filter
   - Median Filter
   - Sobel Edge Detection
   - Canny Edge Detection

### 4. **Fourier Transform**
   The final project focuses on applying the Fourier Transform to images. This technique transforms the image into the frequency domain, allowing for the removal of specific frequencies (e.g., noise) and the enhancement of other features.
   - Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
   - Frequency filtering
   - Inverse Fourier Transform to reconstruct the processed image

   **Techniques Used:**
   - Fourier Transform
   - Low-pass/High-pass frequency filtering
   - Inverse FFT
